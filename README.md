# OMI Scripting Working Group

The OMI Scripting Working Group discusses interoperable metaverse scripting between platforms. Our group also considers recommendations for platform implementors on safety, security and compatibility. The group is comprised of representatives from virtual world platforms and other creators working on the metaverse.
