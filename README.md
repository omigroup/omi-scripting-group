# OMI Scripting Working Group

## Working Agreement

The OMI Scripting Working Group is working to produce a standard for scripting within metaverse environments that is interoperable between platforms, using the existing WASM runtime standard.

Make recommendations for platform implementers on safety, security and compatibility.

The group is comprised of representatives from virtual world platforms and other creators working on the metaverse.

We host our weekly meetings live [on Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) on Tuesdays from 1630 - 1700 UTC in the #omi-weekly-meeting voice channel. Our meeting agendas and notes can be found in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/omi-wasm-group/discussions) and our WASM related discussions take place in the #omi-wasm-group channel.
