# omi-wasm-group

Welcome, we're just getting started! This group is intended to explore the realm of adding support for scripting for user generated content in "metaverse" applications. What all that means is still yet to be defined.

Join us in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/omigroup/omi-wasm-group/discussions/4) to help us outline our goals and plan our first meeting sometime in the first two weeks of January.

This group is a subgroup of the [Open Metaverse Interoperability Group](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup). Feel free to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) and chat with us there.
