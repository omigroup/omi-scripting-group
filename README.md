# OMI Scripting Working Group

The OMI Scripting Working Group is working to produce a standard for scripting within metaverse environments that are interoperable between platforms using the existing WASM runtime standard. Our group also makes recommendations for platform implementors on safety, security and compatibility. The group is comprised of representatives from virtual world platforms and other creators working on the metaverse.
